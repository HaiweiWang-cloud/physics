            </h1>

            <p>Sandbox games, like Minecraft, offer the player infinite space for creativity. Like the real world, Minecraft has its own laws of physics. One disturbing law is that blocks can float in midair. In a sense, the real world is like a sort of sandbox game, with a fundamental set of laws within which we play. This ongoing project is dedicated to demonstrating some of the interesting implications of the laws through interactive simulations.</p>
